I am a **Penetration Tester** with a strong passion for **Android security** and **reverse engineering**.  
My professional focus is on analyzing, breaking down, and securing applications and systems, with a particular interest in low-level behavior, malware analysis, and uncovering complex security flaws.

When I’m not in front of a terminal, I dedicate my time to physical training — I’m an enthusiast of both the gym and **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu**.  
I’m also a passionate **AS Roma** supporter and share my life with a cat named **Tribola**, who supervises my work from the comfort of my desk.

This blog is where I document research, share technical write-ups, and explore security topics that I find challenging and relevant.  
My goal is to contribute to the security community by providing detailed, reproducible analyses and insights into emerging threats.
